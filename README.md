### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I am Smriti , a btech undergraduate ,interested in the field of hardware desingning.

I do have a interest in VLSI, FPGA prototyping, RTL Design and verification. 
During my undergrad I did a lot of projects involving the FPGAs and also programmed them using the hardware description language like Verilog, also tinkered a lot of FPGAs, microcontrollers and circuit design.

Apart from hardware design , I am also into software development basically web development

I am also into Open Source, and a contributor at Girl Script Summer of Code'23

Here are some ideas to get you started:
 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Open Source Contribution
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on different projects based on web development   
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about FPGA, VLSI 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: 
- âš¡ Fun fact:I am into both hardware and software designing
